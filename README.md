> Rapping a js application over Wu-Tang Clan beat (Tearz)

## Why?

I just wanted to see if I could rap source code for a working application.

## Project Goals

1. Try not to be too cheesy, cause you know, it's a novelty item
2. It should be a functional application
  - Every lyric should translate to working code
  - It should be verbose enough to work, but abstract enough to flow

## Goals Achieved?

1. Eh, maybe
2. Yes, with caveats
  - The end user must be knowledgeable in JS terminology and programming
  - Blocks, lines, parenthesis, etc... are all implicit
  - Requires node env and installing axios (`npm i axios`)
  - Variable names are spoken as multiple words, need concatenated
